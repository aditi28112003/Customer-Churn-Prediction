# Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer churn using a telecom dataset.

 Features

    End-to-end machine learning workflow for classification

    Preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding, and scaling

    Trained using Random Forest for robust performance

    Interactive Streamlit web app for real-time predictions

    Visual dashboard for analyzing churn trends

Tech Stack

    Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn

    Random Forest Classifier, Joblib

    Streamlit (for UI)

    Sample dataset in data/telecom_churn.csv

How It Works

    Run train_model.py to preprocess data and train a model.

    Launch app.py using Streamlit to test predictions.

    Input customer data and get real-time churn predictions!
