# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based solution to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn or not, based on their account activity, tenure, charges, and service usage patterns. It demonstrates the full ML pipeline from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.
